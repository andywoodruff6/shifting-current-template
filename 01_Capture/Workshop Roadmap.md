## Why This System Works

Your files live in a folder on your computer. Plain text. Markdown. Nothing proprietary.

**Obsidian** is the human side. **Your AI** is the machine side. **The files are the bridge.**

## After the Session

- **Use your daily note every day** — even if it's just a sentence
- **Try one workflow per day** for the first week to build the habit
- **Ask the AI to build new workflows** whenever you find yourself doing repetitive work
- **Reach out to Andy** if something breaks or doesn't make sense
