**Alice Smith**: Hey Bob, thanks for hopping on. I know you're busy.
*00:12*

**Bob Thompson**: No problem, Alice. I've been meaning to catch up with you anyway. What's on your mind?
*00:16*

**Alice Smith**: So I had a session with Andy last week — you know Andy Woodruff? He set me up with this AI workspace thing. And honestly, it's been kind of eye-opening.
*00:23*

**Bob Thompson**: Yeah, he mentioned something about that to me too. What did he set up exactly?
*00:28*

**Alice Smith**: It's this system called Obsidian — it's basically a folder of text files on your computer, but it's way more powerful than it sounds. You can link notes together, track tasks, build databases. And then he layered an AI assistant on top of it that reads and writes to the same files.
*00:42*

**Bob Thompson**: So the AI can see everything in your notes?
*00:45*

**Alice Smith**: Right. So like, I had a meeting yesterday, recorded it on my phone, and then I just pasted the transcript into the AI chat and it spit out structured notes — action items, decisions, the whole thing. And it automatically updated the contact files for everyone who was in the meeting.
*01:02*

**Bob Thompson**: Wait, it updates contact files automatically?
*01:05*

**Alice Smith**: Yeah. So I have a file for each person I work with — when I last talked to them, what we discussed, open action items. The AI just appends to those when it processes a meeting transcript. I used to spend like 30 minutes after every meeting organizing my notes. Now it's maybe 2 minutes.
*01:22*

**Bob Thompson**: That's actually really compelling. My team spends a ridiculous amount of time on meeting follow-ups. We have like 15 recurring meetings a week across the operations group and half the action items just disappear into the ether.
*01:36*

**Alice Smith**: That's exactly the problem this solves. The action items show up in your daily note, so they don't get lost.
*01:42*

**Bob Thompson**: Ok so tell me more about how the AI side works. Is this ChatGPT or what?
*01:47*

**Alice Smith**: Andy set me up with something called Augment. It runs inside VS Code — which is like a text editor developers use. But the key thing is it can read and write files on your computer. So you point it at your Obsidian vault and it has full context about your work.
*02:04*

**Bob Thompson**: And it's not sending your data to some cloud?
*02:07*

**Alice Smith**: I mean, the AI model is cloud-based — it's doing the processing remotely. But your files stay on your machine. It's not like uploading everything to Google Docs or whatever. It reads the file, processes it, writes the result back to your local folder.
*02:20*

**Bob Thompson**: Ok that's reasonable. What else can it do besides meeting notes?
*02:24*

**Alice Smith**: There's five workflows he set up. Meeting notes is the big one. But there's also a visual content thing — like if I need a blog header or an infographic, I describe what I want and the AI writes the image prompt. Then I paste that into ChatGPT or whatever image tool and it generates the visual.
*02:42*

**Bob Thompson**: So it doesn't make the image itself?
*02:44*

**Alice Smith**: No, the AI writes the prompt. You take the prompt to an image generator. Two steps. But honestly the prompts are way better than what I would write myself. I used to spend 20 minutes trying to describe what I wanted to DALL-E. Now I just say "blog header about supply chain resilience" and the AI writes a detailed creative brief.
*03:04*

**Bob Thompson**: That's clever. What else?
*03:07*

**Alice Smith**: Newsletter builder — you dump in raw content throughout the week and then on Friday you paste it into the AI and it formats everything into a polished newsletter. Knowledge capture — for when you have a brain dump or article you want to file into the right place. And a daily kickoff where the AI reviews your vault and helps you plan your day.
*03:28*

**Bob Thompson**: The daily kickoff is interesting. We've been trying to get people to do better daily standups and half the team just wings it.
*03:35*

**Alice Smith**: Right? And the thing that blew my mind — Andy showed me that I'm not limited to those five workflows. I can just describe any repetitive task and the AI builds a new workflow for me. Like I told it about our quarterly business review format and it created a prompt that generates the whole QBR from raw data.
*03:55*

**Bob Thompson**: Ok, I'm sold on the concept. But let me push back on one thing. My team is not technical at all. Half of them are still figuring out Excel. Is this actually accessible for normal people?
*04:04*

**Alice Smith**: That's what I thought too. But honestly, once it's set up, you're just copying a prompt and pasting it. You don't need to know anything about code. Obsidian looks like any other note-taking app. The hard part is the initial setup, and that's what Andy does for you.
*04:20*

**Bob Thompson**: What's the cost situation?
*04:22*

**Alice Smith**: Obsidian is free. The AI is whatever your company already pays for — we have Augment through work, so there was no additional cost for me. If you don't have a company AI subscription, Claude is like $20 a month.
*04:35*

**Bob Thompson**: We have Augment licenses through IT. Most people just use it for code completion though.
*04:40*

**Alice Smith**: Same. I didn't even realize it could do this stuff until Andy showed me. It's like having a Swiss Army knife and only using the bottle opener.
*04:48*

**Bob Thompson**: Ha. Ok so here's what I'm thinking. I want to see this in action. Not just hear about it — I want to watch you process a meeting transcript live. Can we do that?
*04:58*

**Alice Smith**: Yeah absolutely. Want to do it Thursday? I have a product review meeting Wednesday afternoon and I can record that and then process it while you watch on Thursday morning.
*05:09*

**Bob Thompson**: Thursday morning works. Let's say 9 AM.
*05:12*

**Alice Smith**: Done. I'll have the transcript ready and I'll walk you through the whole thing.
*05:16*

**Bob Thompson**: And then if it's as good as you're saying, I want to talk to Andy about setting up a session for my operations leads. Maybe three or four of them to start.
*05:25*

**Alice Smith**: You should reach out to him. He's doing these as one-on-one workshop sessions right now — like a single afternoon and you walk away with everything running on your machine.
*05:34*

**Bob Thompson**: What's the pitch again? Like if I'm explaining this to my director?
*05:38*

**Alice Smith**: AI can do 833 times more knowledge work per dollar than a human. That's not some future prediction — that's the math right now. The tools exist. Most people just don't know how to use them yet. Andy teaches you how in one session.
*05:52*

**Bob Thompson**: 833 times. Where does that number come from?
*05:55*

**Alice Smith**: He showed me the calculation. It's based on the cost of an AI processing a task versus the cost of a human doing the same thing at average knowledge worker salary. The actual number might vary by task but the order of magnitude is real.
*06:08*

**Bob Thompson**: That's the kind of number that gets attention in a budget meeting.
*06:12*

**Alice Smith**: Exactly. And the thing is, this isn't about replacing people. It's about making people way more effective. I'm still doing my job — I'm just spending 30 minutes less per meeting on admin work. Multiply that across a week and it's significant.
*06:28*

**Bob Thompson**: Yeah, if each of my ops leads saves even 30 minutes a day, that's 10 hours a week we get back across the team. That's meaningful.
*06:37*

**Alice Smith**: And it compounds. The more you use it, the more context the AI has about your work, the more useful it gets. My daily kickoff this morning actually surfaced a follow-up I'd forgotten about because it read through my meeting notes from last week.
*06:52*

**Bob Thompson**: Ok I have two action items from this. One — Thursday 9 AM, you demo the meeting notes workflow for me live. Two — I'm going to reach out to Andy this week about setting up sessions for my team.
*07:04*

**Alice Smith**: And I have one too — I need to put together a short summary of the five workflows with examples so you can share it with your director if you need to make the case internally.
*07:14*

**Bob Thompson**: That would be great. Even just a one-pager.
*07:17*

**Alice Smith**: I'll have it by Thursday. Actually — I'll ask the AI to write it for me. Perfect use case.
*07:23*

**Bob Thompson**: Ha. Using the tool to sell the tool. I like it.
*07:26*

**Alice Smith**: That's the whole point, right? If the tool can't help you do this kind of thing, it's not worth much.
*07:31*

**Bob Thompson**: Fair enough. Alright, Thursday 9 AM. I'll send you a calendar invite.
*07:35*

**Alice Smith**: Sounds good. Talk to you then, Bob.
*07:38*

**Bob Thompson**: Thanks, Alice. This was really helpful.
*07:40*
