# AI Workspace Configuration

This is your personal AI workspace. Claude Code uses this file to understand your project.

## About This Vault

This is an Obsidian-based knowledge management system with AI-powered workflows.

## Folder Structure

- `01_Capture/` — Daily notes and quick capture. New content starts here.
- `02_Projects/` — Active project folders. Move work here when it becomes a project.
- `03_Archives/` — Completed or reference material. Things you're done with but want to keep.
- `04_Assets/` — Cheat sheets, templates, reference docs.
- `99_Templates/` — Obsidian templates for daily notes, meeting notes, etc.

## Available Skills

Skills are invoked with `/skill-name` in Claude Code:

- `/process-meeting` — Process a meeting transcript into structured notes + update personnel files
- `/art` — Generate visual content (blog headers, infographics, illustrations, technical diagrams)
- `/newsletter` — Build a formatted newsletter or report from a structured data file

## Conventions

- Use `[[wikilinks]]` to connect notes in Obsidian
- Daily notes go in `01_Capture/` with format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- One project per folder in `02_Projects/`
- When a project is done, move it to `03_Archives/`
