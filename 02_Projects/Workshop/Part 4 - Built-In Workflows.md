# Part 4 - Built-In Workflows
---

This vault comes with five ready-to-use prompt templates in `04_Assets/prompts/`. Each one is a workflow you copy into your AI chat.

| # | Workflow | What It Does |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | [[01-meeting-notes\|Meeting Notes]] | Transcript in, structured notes + people file updates out |
| 2 | [[02-visual-content\|Visual Content]] | AI writes image generation prompts for you |
| 3 | [[03-newsletter-report\|Newsletter / Report]] | Raw content in, polished formatted output out |
| 4 | [[04-knowledge-capture\|Knowledge Capture]] | Organize and file information into your vault |
| 5 | [[05-daily-kickoff\|Daily Kickoff]] | AI reviews your vault and helps plan your day |

## How to Use Them

1. Open the prompt template file (in Obsidian or VS Code)
2. Copy the prompt (everything inside the code block)
3. Replace the `[BRACKETED]` sections with your content
4. Paste into your AI chat
5. Review what the AI produces

**Start with Meeting Notes** — it's the most impressive demo and the most immediately useful.

## Tips

- You don't need to memorize these. Keep the prompts folder open and copy when needed.
- Customize over time. Edit the templates to match your specific work patterns.
- The AI can read your vault. Reference files by path instead of pasting content when possible.
