# Part 3 - Using AI With Obsidian
---

Now that you know the tool, let's connect the AI.

Your AI assistant (Augment, in VS Code) can read and write files in any folder you open. By opening your vault folder in VS Code, the AI has access to everything — your notes, your meeting files, your people records.

## The Setup

1. Open your vault folder in VS Code (`File > Open Folder`)
2. Open Augment's chat panel
3. Ask it something: *"Read the file at 01_Capture/Workshop Roadmap.md and summarize it"*

If it responds with a summary, you're connected. The AI can now work with your vault.

## What the AI Can Do

- Read any note and summarize or analyze it
- Create new notes with proper frontmatter and structure
- Update existing files (add to meeting notes, update people records)
- Search across your vault for information
- Process raw content into structured notes

## What It Can't Do (Yet)

- Generate images directly (but it can write prompts you take to an image tool)
- Access the internet on its own (but you can paste content in)

## The Key Insight

The AI is not a separate tool from your vault — it's a collaborator that works on the same files you do. When it creates a meeting note, you see it in Obsidian instantly. When you add a note in Obsidian, the AI can read it next time you ask.

This is why Obsidian is the foundation. It's the shared workspace between you and the AI.
