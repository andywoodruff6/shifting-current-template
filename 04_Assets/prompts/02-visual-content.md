# Visual Content Prompt

Your AI assistant can write image generation prompts for you. You then paste those prompts into an image tool (ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, or any image generator you have access to).

**Two-step process:** AI writes the prompt, you generate the image.

Copy everything below the line into your AI chat. Replace the `[BRACKETED]` sections.

## Blog Header Image

```
I need a professional blog header image for an article about:

[DESCRIBE YOUR ARTICLE TOPIC — 1-2 sentences]

The tone is: [professional / creative / technical / playful — pick one]

Write me an image generation prompt I can paste into ChatGPT or DALL-E. The prompt should describe:
- A 16:9 landscape editorial image
- Modern, clean style suitable for a professional blog
- A visual metaphor that captures the article's theme
- No text or words in the image

Give me 2-3 prompt options to choose from, each with a different visual approach.
```

## Infographic / Data Visual

```
I need to visualize this data:

[PASTE YOUR DATA, STATS, OR KEY NUMBERS HERE]

The context is: [what this data is about and who will see it]

Write me an image generation prompt for a clean infographic that:
- Presents the key numbers clearly
- Uses a professional color palette
- Has clear visual hierarchy (most important number biggest)
- Includes a title and section labels

Give me the prompt I can paste into an image generator.
```

## Abstract Illustration

```
I need an abstract illustration representing this concept:

[DESCRIBE THE CONCEPT OR IDEA — e.g., "the tension between speed and quality in software development"]

The tone is: [thoughtful / bold / contemplative / energetic — pick one]

Write me an image generation prompt for an abstract, metaphorical illustration that:
- Captures the essence of the concept without being literal
- Uses sophisticated visual metaphors
- Would work as a standalone piece or article illustration
- No text or words in the image

Give me 2-3 prompt options with different visual metaphors.
```

## Technical Diagram

```
I need a technical diagram showing:

[DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM, PROCESS, OR ARCHITECTURE]

The components are:
- [Component 1 — what it does]
- [Component 2 — what it does]
- [Component 3 — what it does]

The relationships are:
- [Component 1 connects to Component 2 because...]
- [Component 2 feeds into Component 3 because...]

Write me an image generation prompt for a clean technical diagram with:
- Clear labels on each component
- Arrows showing data/process flow
- Professional style suitable for documentation or presentations
- Logical layout (top-to-bottom or left-to-right)
```

## Tips

- **Image generators are free or cheap.** ChatGPT (Plus), Bing Image Creator (free), or DALL-E can all use the prompts your AI writes.
- **Iterate.** If the first image isn't right, tell the image generator what to change.
- **Save images to your vault.** Put generated images in `04_Assets/` so they stay with your notes.
