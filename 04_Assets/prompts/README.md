## The Templates

| Template | What It Does | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Meeting Notes** | Turns a meeting transcript into structured notes with action items | After any meeting you recorded or took notes in |
| **Visual Content** | Generates image prompts for blog headers, infographics, illustrations | When you need a visual and don't have a designer |
| **Newsletter / Report** | Turns raw content into a polished, formatted newsletter or report | Weekly reports, team updates, client newsletters |
| **Knowledge Capture** | Helps you organize and file new information into your vault | When you have notes, articles, or ideas to process |

## Tips

- **You don't need to memorize these.** Keep this folder open and copy when needed.
- **Customize over time.** Edit the templates to match your specific work patterns.
- **The AI can read your vault.** If your vault folder is open in VS Code, the AI can reference any file in it. Use that to your advantage.
