# Workshop Roadmap

## What We're Building Today

By the end of this session, you'll have a personal AI-powered workspace running on your computer. Not a subscription service. Not someone else's platform. Your files, your machine, your control.

## The Big Picture

Email was once too technical for the average office worker. Someone had to teach them. We're at that exact moment again with AI — except these tools are more powerful and the window to learn is shorter.

AI can do 833x more knowledge work per dollar than a human. That's not a prediction — it's today's math. The question isn't whether you'll use these tools. It's whether you learn now or scramble later.

## What You'll Walk Away With

1. **Obsidian Vault** — Your personal knowledge system. Organized, searchable, and growing with you.
2. **AI Agent** — Claude Code installed and operational. It reads your files, runs your workflows, and helps you work at a fundamentally different speed.
3. **Meeting Notes Workflow** — Record any meeting. Get structured notes and automatic stakeholder file updates.
4. **Visual Content Workflow** — Generate blog headers, infographics, illustrations, and technical diagrams on demand.
5. **Report/Newsletter Workflow** — Feed in your data, get a formatted professional output. Same template, fresh content, every time.

## Today's Session Plan

| Step | What | Time |
|------|------|------|
| 1 | **Orient** — You're reading this right now. Review the cheat sheets next. | 10-15 min |
| 2 | **Configure** — Set up API keys, authenticate Claude Code | 10 min |
| 3 | **Test Workflows** — Run each of the 5 workflows together | 60-90 min |
| 4 | **Customize** — Adjust the system to your specific work | 30 min |

## Next Steps

After this session:
- Use your daily note in `01_Capture/` every day — even if it's just a sentence
- Try one workflow per day for the first week to build the habit
- Reach out to Andy if something breaks or doesn't make sense
